# Active-Brownian-Bugs
The read-me-text for the source codes of Active Brownian Bug model [1]  
All codes were written by Seiya Takamura

## (1) Command line argument
Most of code requires five integer command line arguments: seed, e_L, e_Dr, e_v0, and e_Dth.  
“seed” specifies the random number seed.  
“e_L” determines the system size, with the box length L calculated as L = e_L / 10.  
“e_Dr”, “e_v0”, and “e_Dth” specify the value of translational diffusivity D_r, self-propulsion velocity v_0, and angular diffusivity D_theta, respectively. For example, setting D_r = 2 * 10 ^ {-5} corresponds to e_Dr = 205, and D_r = 1.5 * 10 ^ {-3} corresponds to e_Dr = 1504.  

## (2) Main source code
the main code: ___bb-20250318.c  
compile: gcc ___bb-20250318.c -o out -lm -O3  
run: ./out seed e_L e_Dr e_v0 e_Dth > _bb-20250318-data-seed-e_L-e_Dr-e_v0-e_Dth.txt  
Data file is generated by this code.  
for example:  
_bb-20250318-data-0-10-105-103-203.txt  
_bb-20250318-data-0-10-506-503-203.txt  
_bb-20250318-data-0-10-205-102-203.txt  
_bb-20250318-data-0-10-505-504-203.txt  

## (3) Snapshot
To create snapshots (figs.1a,d,g,j), use the following code: ___bb-20250318-snapshot.py  
run: python ___bb-20250318-snapshot.py seed e_L e_Dr e_v0 e_Dth  

## (4) Graph
To create graphs of pair correlation function (figs.1b,e,h,k) and orientational order parameter (figs.1c,f,i,l), use the following code: ___bb-20250318-graph.py  
run: python ___bb-20250318-graph.py seed e_L e_Dr e_v0 e_Dth  

## (5) Phase diagram
From data file in (1), diagram data is generated by using the following code: ___bb-20250318-aggregation.py  
run: python ___bb-20250318-aggregation.py seed e_L e_Dr e_v0 e_Dth  
Diagram data generated by this code are, for example:  
_bb-20250318-data_diagram-0-10-105-103-203.txt  
_bb-20250318-data_diagram-0-10-506-503-203.txt  
_bb-20250318-data_diagram-0-10-205-102-203.txt  
_bb-20250318-data_diagram-0-10-505-504-203.txt  
To create phase diagrams (figs.2a-c), use the following code: ___bb-20250318-diagram.py  
run: python ___bb-20250318-diagram.py
